# new project

over here: [https://github.com/hunterdyar/hunters-asset-db](https://github.com/hunterdyar/hunters-asset-db) is a new version of this project that I wrote myself with react, instead of this site made with Hugo.


# asset-collection

Website + Repository of assets for 3D development. As with most of my research, the goal is to make VR/AR and creative coding development more accessible. Here, the assets I create and add are intended for student project use.
